# Noughts and crosses refactoring challenge

Noughts and crossed (aka TicTacToe) is a simple two player game. Players take it in turns of marking a square in 3x3 grid with a nought `O` or a cross `X`. A player wins by having three of their marks in any row, column or diagonal.

This version works but needs cleaning up, good luck!

## Hints
- Are there any builtins you can use to simplify the logic?
- Can you separate game logic and display logic?
- Can you make the NoughtsAndCrosses class testable?
- Think about extensibility, how would it be easy to:
    - Add computer players
    - Allow undos
    - Replay all moves by printing out all positions from the start
    - Play multiple games and keep score
